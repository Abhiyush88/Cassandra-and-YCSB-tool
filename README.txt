==========

Deploy Cassandra-based system on clouds to handle the information of large number of concurrent users for a client and benchmark performance for 3 different cloud providers to provide a cost-effective solution.


Project Description:
---------------------
1. Launch multiple cloud servers on Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Compute Engine.

2. Deploy Cassandra cluster, with different set of concurrent users, on each cloud service provider and benchmark their results using Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark tool.

3. Compare and analyze different cloud service providers in terms of cost and performance using the benchmark results in order to provide a cost-effective solution to a client hosting information of large number of concurrent users.
